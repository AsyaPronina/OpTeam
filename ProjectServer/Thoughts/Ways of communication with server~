Two ways of creating connections:
Server:
1. Create passive listen socket. Create new communication socket on each new transaction on server and close it after transaction is completed. Store map of clients and IPs.
2. Create passive listen socket. Create new communication socket on each new connection from different client. Hold one socket per client active.
Client:
1. Create new active socket on each transaction operation, send request, receive response from this socket and close it.
2. Create one socket to server. Negotiate with server.
